# in python programming language, we have three types of Comments
# first tha we are writing which is start with '#' symbol

# the second is the inline or end line comment when we write a statement in python than we create a comment like this
print("Hello World!")  # this will print a hello world in console, So this is called inline or end line comment

# the third type is multiline comment which comment's more than one lines

# multiline
# multiline
# multiline     and more

# but for multiline comment we have another easy-to-write method like this

"""
    with triple Double cots Or single cots we 
    create multiline comment 
    that is work perfectly for 
    comment's that is more than one line for a developer
"""

# EXAMPLES

# This line of code will print a hello world!
print("Hello World!")


print("Inline or end line comment")  # this will print end line comment

'''
    multiline comment will print that in multiline comment 
'''

print("The above comment is multiline comment.")
